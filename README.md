# Elements Scroll Animation Library V 0.1.0

This is the first version of the library made by myself, it still has
some issues, I will still working in this to improve it.

## How to use it

Be sure the entire project is in the same folder.

In the index file you can find how the animations are displayed and how to
use them in your project using the classes and attributes.

To start using the animations just add the files myScrollAnimations.css
and myScrollAnimations.js to your project, link them and add the necessary data
to your elements.
